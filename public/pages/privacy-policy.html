      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>DragonMaps ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our website, DragonMaps (the "Service"), a battlemap creator for tabletop role-playing games or the like.</p>
      <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>DragonMaps is primarily a client-side application hosted on Github Pages. This means that most operations occur in your web browser, and we do not collect, store, or process personal data on any servers.</p>
      <p>However, please note:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your browser may store data locally to improve your user experience (e.g., saving your creations).</li>
        <li>We use a cookie to manage the display of our feedback popup.</li>
        <li>Github, our hosting provider, may collect certain information as described in their Privacy Statement.</li>
        <li>We use Microsoft Clarity to help us understand how users interact with our website (more details below).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>3. Use of Cookies and Analytics</h2>
      <p>We use a single cookie to remember when we've shown you our feedback request popup. This cookie helps us ensure we don't show you the popup too frequently. Specifically:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cookie Name: 'feedback_popup_shown'</li>
        <li>Purpose: To record when the feedback popup was last shown to you</li>
        <li>Duration: 30 days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can control and/or delete cookies as you wish. For details, see <a href="aboutcookies.org">aboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
      <p>GitHub Pages may also use cookies and similar technologies. Please refer to GitHub's Privacy Statement for more information.</p>
      <h3>Microsoft Clarity</h3>
