# Dragon Maps Update
<hr>

So, it's unlikely that anyone would have followed the migration but dragon-maps is no longer hosted or running on GitHub. * Insert cheering here * I have moved to a different service and with that, I have gotten a better domain name which is entirely free ("dragon-maps.web.app)â€¦ well it's much better in my opinion as opposed to ("jamster3000/dragonmaps.github.io"). 

## What are the benefits of this migration
Without going into detail this migration provides several benefits (not looking at the fact, everything is still entirely free). This migration provides me with usable storage (alright, given it's not much but it's still decent), as mentioned, a better domain name, although you won't see any difference, it's somehow considered faster than GitHub Pages are. Along with this, this migration also includes several free services that you might see in the distant future. For example, authentication (aka, accounts and logging in). Amongst other services too of course.
