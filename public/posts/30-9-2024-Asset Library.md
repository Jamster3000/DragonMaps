# Update to the Asset Library
<hr>

The asset Library for Dragon Maps Designer will be down for the next few weeks. It is due to a development phrase where the current storage solution for the images are not suitable enough, so instead it will be changing to something better and more adaptable.

Once the asset library is back up, there will be more images (26,000+ in total) and keywords for each asset will have been greatly enhanced to get more relevant and better results when searching for that perfect asset for you map.
