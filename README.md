# DragonMaps©

DragonMaps is a free to use battlemap maker with Tabletop Role Playing games specifically in mind. WHen I say for TTRPG's I mean virtual Tabletops such as Roll20, Foundry, and the awesome **__Cauldron VTT__**. There are a lot of plans for this, so far, DragonMaps© is sill in it's early days, with exciting plans for the future.  Whether you're crafting an epic encounter or working on designing a detailed world, DragonMaps© provides a user-friendly platform to create and bring your maps to life.

# Features

Currently, DragonMaps© offers a basic set of features to help you create your battlemaps quickly and easily:
- Intuitive Interfact: Simple drag-and-drop functionality with an awesome unique colour theme.
- Grid: Includes a square grid where it's visibiliy can be toggled on and off.
- Asset Library: Includes a currently limited selection of non-comercial, pre-made asets that can be used for non-comercial use with your maps.
- Export: You can currently export your created map as a png file. (You must put the DragonMaps© logo on your map before you can export the map as an image - The watermark image will change to the logo).
- Tools: There are tools to allow you to draw, erase, and place text, using GoogleFonts to apply your own custom fonts (The shape tool is still a work in progress).

While DragonMaps© is still in its (very) early stages, it provides some of the essentials for creating and exporting very simple battlemaps. I plan to add additional features and enhancements to make DragonMaps a free powerful tool for everyone to create awesome battlemaps.

# RoadMap
Rather than listing everything there is planned to impliment here, just take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/Jamster3000/dragonmaps/issues) Page for a list of all features, enhancements and bugs. Alternitivly you can take a look at [Project DragonCode](https://github.com/users/Jamster3000/projects/11) to see what will and won't be worked on, what is currently being worked on, and what has already been done.

# Usage
Whilst DragonMaps© is in development, there will be no instructions on how to use it (because things are always changing and evolving). Once I can officially announce that it has reached a production standard, I will use DragonMaps© [tutorals](https://jamster3000.github.io/dragonmaps/pages/tutorials) page to help those who are new to DragonMap© Designer or just for those that aren't very skilled in computers and website alike.

# Contributing
DragonMaps© is an open-source project, I don't request nor desire payment or anything in return, the reward for this is all about doing it for the community. I like to think of myself as a lone programmer and developer so despite the issues and bugs I prefer to keep things developed by myself, thus allowing me to take 100% rights to claim the entire development of the website and future projects as my own.

If there is anything you want to do in return for a free to use website, keeping your eye out for any bugs so I can fix them to improve DragonMaps© would be great. Along with this, if you have map assets (trees, wells, fences, etc. you get the idea) that you own copyright to (such as making them yourself), I'd appreciate being able to add them to the asset library allowing everyone use them. For as long as you allow DragonMaps© to use the assets to add to the library and for other's to use, I'm open to agreeing to use them under almost every license (non-comercial or comercial).

To reiterate, while I appreciate help on any development or fixes of the website's code, I'd much rather retain the core development role.
