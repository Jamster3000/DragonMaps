# DragonMaps©

DragonMaps is a free to use battlemap maker with Tabletop Role Playing games specifically in mind. WHen I say for TTRPG's I mean virtual Tabletops such as Roll20, Foundry, and the awesome **__Cauldron VTT__**. There are a lot of plans for this, so far, there is little to nothing that makes DragonMaps unique or even interesting (Besides the funky colour theme).  Whether you're crafting an epic encounter or working on designing a detailed world, DragonMaps© provides a user-friendly platform to create and bring your maps to life.
