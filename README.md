# DragonMaps

DragonMaps is a free to use battlemap maker with Tabletop Role Playing games specifically in mind. When I say for TTRPG's I mean virtual Tabletops such as Roll20, Foundry, and the awesome **__Cauldron VTT__**. There are a lot of plans for this, so far, DragonMaps is sill in it's early days, with exciting plans for the future.  Whether you're crafting an epic encounter or working on designing a detailed world, DragonMaps provides a user-friendly platform to create and bring your maps to life.

# Features
Currently, DragonMaps offers a basic set of features to help you create your battlemaps quickly and easily:
- Intuitive Interfact: Simple drag-and-drop functionality with an awesome unique colour theme.
- Grid: Includes a square grid where it's visibiliy can be toggled on and off.
- Asset Library: Includes a currently limited selection (26,000+) of non-comercial, pre-made asets that can be used for non-comercial use with your maps.
- Export: You can currently export your created map as a png file. This feature is in need of proper development and currently is quite poor quality. The watermark is also required to be on the map but there is no logo so that image is just a placeholder for now.
- Tools: There are tools to allow you to draw, erase, and place text, using your own font files to have unique fonts added to your maps

While DragonMaps is still in its (very) early stages, it provides some of the essentials for creating and exporting very simple battlemaps. I plan to add additional features and enhancements to make DragonMaps a free powerful tool for everyone to create awesome battlemaps.

# Road Map
Rather than listing everything there is planned to impliment here, just take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/Jamster3000/dragonmaps/issues) Page for a list of all features, enhancements and bugs. Alternitivly you can take a look at [Project DragonCode](https://github.com/users/Jamster3000/projects/11) to see what will and won't be worked on, what is currently being worked on, and what has already been done.

# Usage
Whilst DragonMaps is in development, tutorials and guides will be limited with what's available. Once I can officially announce that it has reached a production standard, I will use DragonMaps [tutorals](https://jamster3000.github.io/dragonmaps/pages/tutorials) page to help those who are new to DragonMap Designer or just for those that aren't very skilled in computers and website alike to be able to use and navigate the website. Tutorials and guides will be added slowly throughout the process.

# Contributing
DragonMaps is currently a closed-source project, I don't request nor desire payment or anything in return, the reward for this is all about doing it for the community. I like to think of myself as a lone programmer and developer so despite the issues and bugs I prefer to keep things developed by myself, thus allowing me to take 100% rights to claim the entire development of the website and future projects as my own.

If there is anything you want to do in return for a free to use website, keeping your eye out for any bugs so I can fix them to improve DragonMaps would be great. Along with this, if you have map assets (trees, wells, fences, etc. you get the idea) that you own copyright to (such as making them yourself), I'd appreciate being able to add them to the asset library allowing everyone use them. For as long as you allow DragonMaps to use the assets to add to the library and for other's to use, I'm open to agreeing to use them under almost every license (non-comercial or comercial), some commercial would be really nice as there are few to no assets currently available for commercial.

To reiterate, while I appreciate help on any development or fixes of the website's code, I'd much rather retain the core development role.

To get in contact with me, there are a few different ways.
- [Contact Form](https://dragon-maps.web.app/pages/contact): You can use the contact form on the DragonMaps website to contact me by email.
- [Discussions](https://github.com/Jamster3000/dragonmaps/discussions) - I have never used Discussions on a github repository but feel free to use that to get in contact.
- [Issues](https://github.com/Jamster3000/dragonmaps/issues) - If you uncovered a bug that needs squashing, you can create an issue yourself (provided you have an account for Github). See "Reporting Issues" below for a bit more guidance on this.

# The website is being blocked on your current network
So I typically like to use `https://dragon-maps.web.app` because it looks cleaner. But DragonMaps has a second domain which is much better for networks that block `.web.app` Instead, you can try `https://dragon-maps.firebaseapp.com`

# Reporting Issues
You can report [issues](https://github.com/Jamster3000/dragonmaps/issues) for DragonMaps on this github's repository page. For as long as you're signed in with a github account, you can report bugs, feature requests, etc. here. When you're writing the description please be detailed and specific, if it doesn't make sense, I will almost definitly deregard it (and eventually delete it). If you are submitting a bug this way, please be as detailed as you can to help me able to replicate the bug on my side (the first step to fixing a bug is to know how to make the said bug happen myself). Any screenshots of what happens would be really good to as that helps give me a visulisation of the issue. 

**Please DO NOT submit any confidential or personal details. These should not be required in any bugs or feature requests**

Finally, I hope you enjoy DragonMaps just as much as I am enjoying developing it. Let the magic begin and your maps come to live (figurativly).
