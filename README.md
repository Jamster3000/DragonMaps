### Ideas to make this work without costing anything
- Use github for the front end and javascript for the dynamic of it
- Use cloudflare workers API for processing huge amount of data (use only when optimization fails)
- Noun project for icons API (maybe?)
- use pathfinding.js for smart walls (avoiding objects whilst drawing a wall, terrain generation?)
- canvas as the core for the map area konva for optimization and being able to make things interactable
- use hammer.js to make it mobile friendly
- shadows: three.js?
- drag and drop functionality: interact.js for other features too?
- For my personally made maps, tokens, assets, etc I will use archieve.org as there is no limit on storage and the API can be used to get and upload images
- Consider using paper.js for snapping objects to grid?
- use html2canvas to export?
