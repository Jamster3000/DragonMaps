# Development Stage
<hr>
If you have come accross this website, you'll notice it's not finished yet, there is still a lot of work to do and get working. You're more than welcome to try the website out at any time you'd like. The updates and tutorial pages are likely to be the last pages to be changes because they mostly rely on the designer to be version 1 (currenlty in alpha) and for it to be complete.

I hope to flood the designer with assets that can be used. I started creating a small collection of assets that can be used (legally) and I plan to put them in at a later date. I am likely to be making my own too which does provide much more flexability in how they can be used. If you would be willing to have any of your assets accessable as part of the designer that would be amazing and greatly appreciated. There will be a contact page set up at some point in the near future, but for now, you could always use the discussions page to communicate to me, until then.
