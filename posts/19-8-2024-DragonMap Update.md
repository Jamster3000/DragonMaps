# development Update
So offically I can't say DragonMaps designer is anywhere near to completion but I will say it's come a long way from the last update made.

I just wanted to make a very breif list of things that have been added so far.
- Assets and a okay amount so far (there are many more to come yet)
- Draw and erase tool (including snap to grid, free hand and straight lines)
- Search for assets
- Add text tool where you can have almost any fonts you want
- And much much more

## github
So if you haven't already found it, this website is being run on github pages thus means that all the code files are in a public repository here too. [DragonMaps Github](https://github.com/Jamster3000/dragonmaps) 

Here you'll find all the files that make up DragonMaps. There is also a project page for this so you can get a rough idea of what is happening when, what's being worked on and if. [DragonMaps Project DragonCode](https://github.com/users/Jamster3000/projects/11/views/1)

Finally, there is already a [contact](https://jamster3000.github.io/dragonmaps/pages/contact) form on the website, there is hte discussions page on the DragonMaps github repository (I honestly have never used that so I hope you can use it anyway), and if you find or want to mention an issue, bug, or a feature implimentation for a future DragonMaps update, you can use the issues tab in the DragonMaps repository (if you have a github account) where you can submit your own things there which I will look at and deal with appropiatly.

May your dragons be friendly and your maps be undevelopedly epic.
